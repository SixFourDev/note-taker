## Description

The motivation behind this tool was to implement what we've learned this week with Express.js, and create this tool to help users stay organized with their to-do list, and have them create notes with short descriptions.

## Installation

To be able to use this tool, simply clone the repo from https://github.com/SixFourDev/note-taker, then open it in VS Code. Then open your terminal in VS Code by right clicking "server.js" and click "Open in Integrated Terminal". The terminal will present itself at the bottom of your VS Code. Then you're going to want to run "npm install" in your terminal to install all the packages to be able to use the tool.

## Usage

The main page you will be presented with a screen with "Note Taker - Take notes with Express" and a button that says "Get Started". Click the button, and it will take you to another page with two columns, on the left it will say "No saved Notes" and the right will be inputs for "Note Title" and "Note Text". You can now input any note title or note text and on the top right corner a save button will appear. Click save and that note will be saved in the left column. You can make as many notes as you'd like, and you can click them on the left column and will be presented on the right column. If you'd like to delete a note, you can click the trash button and it will be removed from the left column.
